## Welcome to Hanjia's page

My name is Hanjia Zhang, from Chengdu city, SiChuan province of China, A province of Panda's hometown. I've been Norman for study since 2016. It was not easy when i just arriveled here, because as a forienger and speaking english as second language, its pretty hard to communicate with others, and the culture as well. But Fortunately, everyone is friendly to me, also i made friends with several native English speakers and they have helped me a lot.
